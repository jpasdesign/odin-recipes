        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peppermint bark is one of my all time favorite Christmas recipes.
            This layered peppermint bark recipe is one of the best. The soft 
            ganache center contrasts perfectly with the crunchy peppermints.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Line a 9x12 inch baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt half of the white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over
                just barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down 
                the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Spread the white 
                chocolate into the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/4 of the crushed peppermints 
                evenly over white chocolate. Chill until firm, about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt the dark chocolate, heavy cream, and peppermint extract 
                together in the top of a double boiler over just barely simmering water, 
                stirring frequently, until just melted. Quickly pour the chocolate layer 
                over the chilled white chocolate layer; spread evenly. Chill until firm, 
                about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt the remaining white chocolate in the top of a double boiler 
                over just barely simmering water, stirring frequently, until just melted. 
                Spread quickly over the chilled bark. Sprinkle with the remaining peppermint 
                pieces; chill until firm, about 20 minutes. Cut or break into small pieces to 
                serve.
            </li>
